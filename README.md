# Lesson Modules

The following "modules" are lessons I've developed on my own time to teach core
frontend development concepts. They are free to use for anyone.

## How are they made?

All of the lessons use markdown that's fed in to the very wonderful Deckset to
output PDFs. Ideally this format is flexible for if I want to make reveal.js
slides or something else in the future.
