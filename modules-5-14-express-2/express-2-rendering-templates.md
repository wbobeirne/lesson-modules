# Rendering As We Know It

* So far, we've rendered static HTML files that we then make dynamic on the client using Javascript
* This has worked well because most of our dynamic content has come from user input (song files, todo list items etc.)
* But now that we're dealing with data in Node, we need that dynamic content to work on our server, not the client

---

## Example Problem: Menu Website

* We're making a website for a client who runs a cafe
* They provide us an array of objects for menu items:
* How do we render this menu in HTML?

```js
const menu = [{
	item: "Coffee",
	price: 2.95,
}, {
	item: "Croissant",
	price: 3.95,
}, /* rest of the menu... */]
```

---

## Example Solution: Doing it Manually

* We could just write out each element manually in HTML:
* But this is time consuming, and won't update with our array
* Plus, we're programmers! We _hate_ doing things by hand...

```html
<ul class="menu">
	<li class="menu-item">Coffee: 2.95</li>
	<li class="menu-item">Croissant: 3.95</li>
	<!-- Rest of the menu... -->
</ul>
```

---

## Example Solution: Add them via jQuery

* We could keep the `menu` in JS, and add each item in jQuery
* But then the user might briefly see an empty menu list
* And search engines or users without JS won't see it at all

```js
var $menu = $(".menu");

for (var i = 0; i < menu.length; i++) {
	var item = menu[i].item + ": $" = menu[i].price;
	$menu.append('<li class="menu-item">' + item + "</li>");
}
```

---

## Example Solution: Use a View Engine

* We briefly encountered view engines in Express earlier, but didn't use it other than to output HTML we hard-coded.
* However, most also allow for dynamic content, not just static HTML.
* If we could iterate over the `menu` array in our template, we could serve up the right HTML.
* For example, it could looks something like...

```html
<ul class="menu">
	<!-- For every menu item... -->
		<li class="menu-item">
			{item}: ${price}
		</li>
	<!-- End for -->
</ul>
```

---

# View Engines: EJS

* EJS -> "Embedded JavaScript", because we _embed_ JS in our template with it
* We can use `<%` to enter JS mode, and `%>` to leave it
* We can also use `<%=` or `<%-` to print out escaped or unescaped values
* With these combined, we can print variables, elements in a loop, or conditionally

```bash
# In terminal
npm install --save ejs
```
```js
// In app.js
app.set("view engine", "ejs");
```

---

## EJS Example: Printing variables

```
<div class="user">
	<img class="user-photo" src="<%= user.photo %>"/>
	<div class="user-name">
		<%= user.name %>
	</div>
	<div class="user-location">
		<%= user.city %>, <%= user.state %>
	</div>
</div>
```

---

## EJS Example: Conditionals

```
<div class="nav">
	<a class="nav-logo" href="/">Home</a>
	<% if (isLoggedIn) { %>
		<a class="nav-link" href="/logout">Logout</a>
	<% } else { %>
		<a class="nav-link" href="/login">Login</a>
	<% } %>
</div>
```

# View Engines: Pug

* Pug (formerly known as Jade) is an engine that aims to _replace_ HTML, rather than simply enhance it like EJS
* Pug does not accept regular HTML, but instead a "cleaner" stripped down version that only takes in the bare minimum
* Rather than explaining, let me just show you some examples:

```bash
# In terminal
npm install --save pug
```
```js
// In app.js
app.set("view engine", "pug");
```

---

# Pug Example: Before (HTML)

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Pug</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Pug - node template engine</h1>
		<div id="container" class="col">
			<p>You are amazing</p>
			<p>
				Pug is a terse and simple templating language with
				a strong focus on performance and powerful features.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

---

# Pug Example: After (Pug)

```
doctype html
html(lang="en")
	head
		title= pageTitle
	body
		h1 Pug - node template engine
		#container.col
			if youAreUsingPug
				p You are amazing
			else
				p Get on it!
			p.
				Pug is a terse and simple templating language with a
				strong focus on performance and powerful features.
```

# How Do We Use Them?

* Once you've installed the module, and `app.set` the view engine, that's it
* However, the real power only comes out if the templates have variables
* We pass these variables as a second object argument to `res.render`
* The keys on this object are available as variables in the template:

```js
// Inside a route in app.js
res.render("template", {
	title: "My website",
	message: "Hello!"
});
```
```html
<!-- views/template.ejs -->
<html>
	<head>
		<title><%= title %></title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1><%= message %></h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

---

# Exercise: Replace Variables

* Choose EJS or Pug as your view engine
* Take one of your portfolio site pages, and find anything that could be a variable (image URL, your title, a list of skills etc.)
* Replace the HTML with variables in your respective view engine
* Add the variables you replaced to your res.render call
* _Bonus Challenge_: Move the variables in to a JSON file, and `require` that file instead of hard-coding the values in app.js

---

## Templates

* At this point, we've made a few HTML pages, and it's getting old
* Most everything in the head tag is identical across your pages
* If you have a header or a footer, you copy and paste them
* Need to make a change to that header or footer? Ha, you're making that change _to each and every page's file._
* It would be nice if we could have one file that every page referenced for these common elements...

---

## Includes to the Rescue

* In addition to loops, conditions, and printing values, most templating languages also support file includes
* What this means is that one template file can include another, and pass it variables as well
* Using this, we can make one master template file that includes individual pages

---

## Example: Template & Include

* We define one template file that contains all of the common elements

```html
<!-- views/template.ejs -->
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Will's Cool Site - <%= title %></title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/style.css"/>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Will's Cool Site</h1>

		<main>
			<%- include("pages/" + page, {
				any: "args",
				you: "want",
				in: "pages/{page}.ejs",
			}); %>
		</main>

		<footer>Â© Will O'Beirne 2017</footer>
	</body>
</html>
```

---

## Example: Template & Include (cont.)

* Then we can re-use it by rendering the template, and passing it the relevant arguments

```js
// app.js
app.get("/", function(req, res) {
	res.render("template", {
		page: "homepage",
		title: "Home",
	});
});

app.get("/about", function(req, res) {
	res.render("template", {
		page: "about",
		title: "About",
	});
});
```

---

## Example: Template & Include (cont.)

```html
<!-- views/pages/homepage.ejs -->
<p>
	Welcome to my homepage! It
	sure is great, ain't it.
</p>
```

```html
<!-- views/pages/about.ejs -->
<p>
	This page was made by Will
	O'Beirne. He's pretty cool.
</p>
```

---

## Exercise: Templatize Your Portfolio Site

* Now that we have the ability to use templates, let's make one for your portfolio site
* Determine what parts of your site should stay the same across all pages (Header, Footer, CSS, etc.) and what parts should be different
* Make a template file for all the parts that are the same
* Move the different parts into their own page files
* Change your routes to res.render the template, and have the template include the pages
