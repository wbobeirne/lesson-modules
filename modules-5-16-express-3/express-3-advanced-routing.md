## Drag & Drop images

### Simply *drop an image onto the Deckset window* and the Markdown you need to display the image is automatically created and *copied to the clipboard.*

---

* This works with both local files and web images
* You donâ€™t _have_ to drag the file, you can also type the Markdown yourself if you know how
