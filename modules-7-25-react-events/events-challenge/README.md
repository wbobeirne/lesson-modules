# NYCDA Basic React Example

* Starting with this example, we'll explore react little by little

## Project Layout

```
.
├── index.html        # The only html file used, open to start the application
├── js                # All our source javascript
│   ├── index.js        # Webpack's entry point, kicks the app off
│   ├── App.js          # Main react component
│   └── components      # Where smaller components are kept
├── dist              # Where compiled webpack files go, not in version control
└── webpack.config.js # Webpack config for `npm run start`
```
