![inline 100%](./assets/var.png)

* `var` - This is a keyword that indicates we're creating a new variable. It should always be present when assigning a new variable, but should not be present when changing the value of an existing variable.
* `[name]` - This is how we'll reference this variable elsewhere in code. It can be any text that has no spaces or special characters. It should be camelCased.
