# [fit] Design Basics

# Why do I need to know design?

* Web developers who have an eye for design are more desirable than those who don't
* While you'll often work with designers, sometimes you'll need to wing it for minor things or admin pages
* If you feel good enough, you can be a one-person web shop offering people full site builds without needing a designer

# Color & Palettes

* When choosing colors, we want to select from a fixed set, not continually introduce unique colors everywhere
* Creating a palette centered around one or two primary colors with various shades reduces visual "noise"
* Use your colors sparingly to highlight particular things you want your users to focus on
* Still room for secondary colors in special conditions

# Typography

* Much like colors, we want to limit our type options to better communicate things to users
* 1-2 fonts at most, _maybe a third_ if you're only using it for something _very_ specific
* Limit your sizes as well, 4-6 sizes is usually more than enough
* High contrast colors for easiest reading

# Style guides

Many companies publish their internal style guides to show how designers adhere to their brand. A ton of these are available, but I few I really like are:

* [Medium](https://www.behance.net/gallery/7226653/Medium-Brand-Development)
* [Spotify](https://issuu.com/bondo/docs/spo_brandidentityguidelines_final)
* [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/)

**Additional reading**

[Visual Mess](http://www.visualmess.com/) - A guide on cleaning up visually messy designs. I looked at a few tutorials, but honestly I think this does the best job of showing rather than telling you design techniques.
